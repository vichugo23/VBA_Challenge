# VBA_Challenge
Stock analysis with VBA

# Overview of Project #

### Purpose ###
The purpose of this project was to refactor a VBA code to gather stock information for the years 2017-2018 and to determine whether or not the stocks are good investsments.

## Data ##
The data shown includes two charts with stock performances for the years 2017-2018 on 12 different stocks. The charts give you the *Ticker, Total Daily Volume,* and the yearly *return* from the stocks.

Results
Analysis
Before refactoring the code, I began by copying the code that was needed to create the input box, chart headers, ticker array, and to activate the appropriate worksheet. The steps were then listed out in order to set the structure for the refactoring. Below is the instruction and code as written in the file.
