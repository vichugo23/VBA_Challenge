# VBA_Challenge
Stock analysis with VBA

# Overview of Project #

### Purpose ###
The purpose of this project was to refactor a VBA code to gather stock information for the years 2017-2018 and to determine whether or not the stocks are good investsments.

## Data ##
The data shown includes two charts with stock performances for the years 2017-2018 on 12 different stocks. The charts give you the **Ticker, Total Daily Volume,** and the yearly **Return** from the stocks.


# Analysis #
Before I had a chance to refactor the code I had to download it and open it using a different app because it wasn't allowing me to open it with Excel. Once I was finally able to access the code I copied and pasted it to my VBA page. I would go back and forth to my old code I had used before during the module to use as refrence and would have to make a few adjustments so the code would run smoothly for this particular assingnment. This was challenging on some parts due to me overlooking some small variable changes. Below I have included the code that I used to come up with the stock analysis with a few comments to guide me and the reader on what is going on as the code is being written out.
